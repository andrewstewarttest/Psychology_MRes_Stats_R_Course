Slides for my MRes Stats course.  Click on the __'Clone or download'__ button in the top right to download a zipped version of this repository.

Each folder contains the slides in .pdf form for the first half of each session, the R script that goes with those slides, and the lab worksheet for the second half as an .html file.  All data files for the lectures and the lab classes are included.  To view the .html file, you might need to first download it and then open it within your browser - ensure it has .html at the end of the file name when you save it. 

Happy coding!  Give me a shout if there are any issues...
