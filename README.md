Slides for my MRes Stats course

Each folder contains the slides for the first half of the 2-hour session, the R script that goes with those slides, and the lab worksheet as for the second half as an .html file.  To view the .html file, you might need to first download it and then open it within your browser - ensure it has .html at the end of the file name when you save it. 

Happy coding!  Give me a shout if there are any issues...
